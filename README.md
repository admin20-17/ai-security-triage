🔐 AI Security Triage

AI Security Triage is a structured, explainable Python-based vulnerability prioritization engine.

It ingests asset and vulnerability data, applies a transparent risk scoring model, categorizes risk types, flags escalation cases, and outputs prioritized remediation guidance.

This project simulates a realistic security triage workflow used by SOC and vulnerability management teams.

🎯 What This Project Does

Merges asset context with vulnerability findings

Applies weighted, explainable risk scoring

Assigns human-readable risk tiers (Critical / High / Medium / Low)

Categorizes risk type (e.g., Network Exposure, Business Impact)

Flags escalation scenarios with justification

Produces decision-ready, sorted output

⚙️ How It Works

1️⃣ Ingestion

Loads assets.csv

Loads vulnerabilities.csv

Merges on asset_id

2️⃣ Risk Scoring Model

Risk score is calculated as:

(severity_cvss × exploitability)
+ (business_criticality × data_sensitivity)
+ exposure_modifier


Where:

External exposure adds additional weight

Output is rounded to an integer

3️⃣ Risk Tier Mapping

Score	Risk Level
≥ 75	Critical
≥ 50	High
≥ 25	Medium
< 25	Low

4️⃣ Risk Categorization

Rule-based tagging for explainability:

Critical Infrastructure

Network Exposure

Exploitable Vulnerability

High Business Impact

General Risk

5️⃣ Escalation Logic

A vulnerability is escalated if:

Risk level is Critical

High risk on an external asset

Business criticality ≥ 8

Exploitability ≥ 8

Output includes:

escalation_flag

escalation_reason

📊 Output

The engine generates:

output/results.csv


Columns include:

run_id

generated_at

Asset context fields

risk_score

risk_level

risk_category

escalation_flag

escalation_reason

Results are sorted by highest risk first.

Console summaries display:

Total rows scored

Findings by risk level
